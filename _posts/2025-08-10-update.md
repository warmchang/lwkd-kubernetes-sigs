## Developer News

Do you run multiple Kubernetes clusters in your organization?  SIG-Multicluster would love to have you [answer their survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwWudp2t0LnXMLiCyv3yUxf_UmCBChN1whK0z3QCN5x8Dj6A/viewform) so that they can decide the SIG's priorities.

The Kubernetes SIG Release main meeting has been rescheduled, based on a community vote, to a fixed time slot of Thursdays from 2:30–3:15 pm UTC, starting August 21, 2025, and will now follow a bi-weekly cadence. The previously alternating meeting times are discontinued, and the next scheduled meeting before the change has been canceled. The time is tied to UTC, so participants in regions with Daylight Saving Time may see a ±1 hour shift. The [calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has been updated, and questions or feedback can be shared via email or the [#sig-release](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C2C40FMNF) Slack channel.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 5080: Ordered Namespace Deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5080-ordered-namespace-deletion/README.md)

This KEP introduces a deterministic, security-aware ordered deletion of all resources within a namespace. Previously, namespace deletion could remove resources in a non-deterministic order that could lead to awkward or risky gaps. When deleting a namespace with the `OrderedNamespaceDeletion` Feature Flag enabled, Kubernetes tears down namespace objects in waves, so that Pods go first and the crucial resources like`NetworkPolicy` Don’t disappear while Pods are still running

This KEP is tracked for Stable in 1.34
