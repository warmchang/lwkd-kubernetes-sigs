## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4317: Pod Certificates](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/4317-pod-certificates)

The `certificates.k8s.io` API group enables requesting X.509 certificates within a Kubernetes cluster but does not directly handle delivering them to workloads. This KEP introduces a `PodCertificateRequest` API, similar to `CertificateSigningRequest`, specifically for pods requesting certificates from a designated signer. It also defines a `PodCertificate` projected volume that allows the kubelet to provision private keys and certificate chains for pods. Together, these components enable secure and automated certificate distribution to pods with minimal burden on developers and administrators. The mechanism is designed for both built-in Kubernetes signers and third-party systems issuing X.509 certificates to cluster workloads.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
