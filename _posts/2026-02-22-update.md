## Developer News
CFP submissions for Open Source Summit India are due March 4. Submit [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-india/program/cfp/).

The CFP for Project Opportunities (Lightning Talks and Maintainer Track) at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India closes on March 1. Submit your proposals [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/features-add-ons/project-opportunities).

The Kubernetes Working Group Serving has been disbanded after completing its objective of advancing AI inference workloads in Kubernetes. Ongoing efforts can transition to existing SIGs and working groups, including SIG Node, SIG Scheduling, SIG Apps, SIG Network, SIG Scalability, and WG Device Management. Congratulations to the WG members on successfully achieving their goals.

[ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) will reach End of Life (EOL) on March 31, concluding its best-effort maintenance period.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:[Feature blog freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#feature-blog-freeze), 27th February 2026 [Code & Test Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#code-freeze), 19th March 2026** 

Feature blog blurbs for v1.36 are due on 27th February 2026. Make sure you’ve opted in and coordinated with Release Comms if your enhancement wants to be featured.

Code & Test Freeze follows 19th March 2026 — enhancements must be merge-ready with approvals, and only release-blocking fixes land after that.

Cherry picks for the March patch release close 6th March 2026, with the release targeted for 10th March 2026.

## Featured PRs

* [137200: Add WorkloadAwarePreemption feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137200)

This PR introduces the `WorkloadAwarePreemption` feature gate as part of KEP-5710. The feature gate lays the groundwork for smarter scheduling decisions that consider workload characteristics during pod preemption, improving fairness and efficiency in cluster resource allocation.

* [137128: Add TopologyAwareWorkloadScheduling feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137128)

This PR adds the `TopologyAwareWorkloadScheduling` feature gate for KEP-5732, enabling upcoming scheduler improvements that take topology constraints into account. This helps prepare Kubernetes for more intelligent workload placement based on node and cluster topology awareness.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4317: Pod Certificates](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/4317-pod-certificates)

The `certificates.k8s.io` API group enables requesting X.509 certificates within a Kubernetes cluster but does not directly handle delivering them to workloads. This KEP introduces a `PodCertificateRequest` API, similar to `CertificateSigningRequest`, specifically for pods requesting certificates from a designated signer. It also defines a `PodCertificate` projected volume that allows the kubelet to provision private keys and certificate chains for pods. Together, these components enable secure and automated certificate distribution to pods with minimal burden on developers and administrators. The mechanism is designed for both built-in Kubernetes signers and third-party systems issuing X.509 certificates to cluster workloads.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.

## Other Merges

* [DaemonSet controller defers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134937) sync on stale cache to prevent duplicate pod creation; adds daemonset_controller_stale_sync_skips_total metric (override via StaleControllerConsistencyDaemonSet=false).
* [Return PreBind-preempted Pods to the backoff queue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135502) instead of deleting them from the apiserver.

* [Add PodGroup scheduling cycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136618) so kube-scheduler can place an entire PodGroup in a single cycle.
* [Fix kubectl logs -f](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136411) to wait for containers to start instead of failing during ContainerCreating/PodInitializing.
* [Updated feature gate `MutablePodResourcesForSuspendedJobs` and `MutableSchedulingDirectivesForSuspendedJobs`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135965) to be enabled by default.
* [Extended PostFilterResult](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136254) with a list of Pods that the PostFilter plugin preempted.

* Drop [ProtoMessage() markers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137084) from k8s.io/api REST types; use apimachinery protobuf serializer instead (KEP-5589).
* [apiserver_rerouted_request_total metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/137063) will expose labels for group, version and resource.
