<br><h2>prometheus/prometheus</h2> <h3>Release notes for 2.53.1 / 2024-07-10</h3><h4>2024-07-10</h4><p>This is a bug-fix release, reverting a change introduced in v2.51.0.</p>

<p>The bug was that remote-write would drop samples if the sending flow stalled for longer than it takes to write one &ldquo;WAL segment&rdquo;. How long this takes depends on the data rate of your Prometheus; as a rough guide with 10 million series scraping once per minute it could be about 5 minutes. The issue is <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/14087" target="_blank">#14087</a>.</p>

<li>[BUGFIX] Remote-write: stop dropping samples in catch-up #14446</li>
