### Release notes for containerd 2.0.0-rc.2  
#### 2024-05-17  
Welcome to the v2.0.0-rc.2 release of containerd!
*This is a pre-release of containerd*

The first major release of containerd 2.x focuses on the continued stability of
containerd's core feature set with an easy upgrade from containerd 1.x. This
release includes the stabilization of new features added in the last 1.x release
as well as the removal of features which were deprecated in 1.x. The goal is to
support the vast community of containerd users well into the future along with
their ever increasing deployment footprints and variety of use cases.

### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.31 (Ubuntu 20.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on non-glibc Linux distributions. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.

See also the [Getting Started](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.

### Release notes for v1.29.0  
#### 2024-05-16  
# Significant changes

## Deferred deletion / pruning phase

Some infrastructure changes are potentially disruptive to the continued
operation of the cluster.  For the most disruptive operations, particularly
those that break rolling-update of the cluster, we have started to use deferred
deletion to minimize the impact.  For example, on AWS we create a second NLB
during the `kops update` phase when we cannot change the NLB directly.
`kops update` will report that a `--prune` is needed.  To minimize disruption,
we recommend you perform this after a rolling-update, for example:

```
kops update $MYCLUSTER --yes --admin
kops rolling-update $MYCLUSTER --yes
kops update $MYCLUSTER --yes --admin --prune # NEW!
```

Deferred deletion is currently used to safely introduce security groups for NLBs on AWS,
and to move to an internal load balancer for `kops-controller` on GCP.

## Initial OpenTelemetry Support

We are starting to add (experimental) support for OpenTelemetry,
in particular Tracing support.  Setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_FILE`
will write a trace file which can then be read by the traceserver program.
More information and options are described in [docs/opentelemetry.md](/docs/opentelemetry.md).
The tracing data is not expected to be particularly useful for end-users in
this release; the (non-standard) recording approach is instead intended to
work well with our Prow end-to-end testing system so that developers can
optimize kOps.

Please note: this is *not* telemetry in the "phone-home" sense.
The kOps project does not collect data from your machine.  As an
open-source project we do not even want to collect any of your data.
Currently the only OpenTelemetry backend supported is writing to a
filesystem (and it is opt-in).  In future you will be able to configure
other OpenTelemetry backends, but this data will only be sent if
you enable OpenTelemetry, and only sent to where you configure.

## AWS

* Network Load Balancers in front of the Kubernetes API and bastion hosts now
have a security group attached. These security groups are used for security group rules
allowing incoming traffic to the NLBs as well as traffic between the NLBs and their target
instances.

* Posts event data to URL upon instance interruption action in aws-node-termination-handler with `WEBHOOK_URL`.

## GCP

* As of Kubernetes version 1.29, credentials for private GCR/AR repositories will be handled by the out-of-tree credential provider. This is an additional binary that each instance downloads from the assets repository.
* Two additional `StorageClasses` are created on GCP clusters. These are called `balanced-csi` and `ssd-csi` and utilize the GCP Balanced and SSD Persistent Disk volume types respectively.
* **Breaking Change** - the default `StorageClass` has been changed from `standard-csi` to `balanced-csi`.

* We now use a private load-balancer for in-cluster traffic on GCP, which allows us
  to use network tags to restrict access only to the cluster nodes.


# Breaking changes

## Other breaking changes

* `kops toolbox dump` limits the number of nodes dumped to 500 by default. Use `--max-nodes` to override.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.23 has been removed.

# Known Issues

* The Amazon VPC CNI is now compatible with Ubuntu 22.04. Fix applied via [kubernetes/kops#16313](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/16313).

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.24 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.30.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.25 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.31.

* Support for AWS Classic Load Balancer for API is deprecated and should not be used for newly created clusters.

* All unmanaged addons (in `addons/`) are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).

## Changelog since v1.30.0

### Changes by Kind

#### Bug or Regression
 - Fixed kubelet image garbage collection when images being referenced as digests instead of IDs. (#8115, @haircommander)

#### Uncategorized
 - Check for nil values when importing container definition for a given container checkpoint to be restored. (#8157, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)
 - Fix a bug where a pod with a userns would fail to be created when `ping_group_range` sysctl was specified for it (and the max of that range was outside of the pods user namespace) (#8186, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)
 - Fix a bug where pinns wasn't setting the sysctls at the correct time when it was also pinning a user namespace (#8155, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)
 - Fixed pod lifecycle regression where the exec PID's got killed before the actual container. (#8179, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)

### Release notes for v0.23.0  
#### 2024-05-14  
This release introduces initial limited support for `nerdctl` and kube-proxy nftables mode.


<h1 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h1>

- The default node image is now Kubernetes 1.30.0: `kindest/node:v1.30.0@sha256:047357ac0cfea04663786a612ba1eaba9702bef25227a794b52890dd8bcd692e`
- `ipFamily` config field is now validated
   - While technically a breaking change, if the value you set here is now caught as invalid it was being silently ignored and creating an ipv4 cluster previously and you should correct your config
-  Go 1.17+ is required for `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind` / building the `kind` binary
   - Prebuilt binaries are available as an alternative to `go install`
   - For local development `make` will automatically setup the correct go version
   - Note that the go team only supports 1.21+ and major linux distros have 1.19+
   - Future releases may increase this to a more current Go release
   - Future release may adopt `toolchain` in go.mod to make this seamless if you have go 1.21+ installed even without our makefile. We highly recommend installing go 1.21+
 
 
<h1 id="new-features">New Features</h1>


- Initial support for nodes created with [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
- Initial support for `kubeProxyMode: nftables` (ahead of Kubernetes 1.31+, see https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode)
- Sweeping dependency updates, see commits for full details. https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0

**NOTE**: You *must* use the `@sha256` digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme. Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.
