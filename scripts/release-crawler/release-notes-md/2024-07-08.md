### Release notes for 2.53.1 / 2024-07-10  
#### 2024-07-10  
This is a bug-fix release, reverting a change introduced in v2.51.0.

The bug was that remote-write would drop samples if the sending flow stalled for longer than it takes to write one "WAL segment". How long this takes depends on the data rate of your Prometheus; as a rough guide with 10 million series scraping once per minute it could be about 5 minutes. The issue is [#14087](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/14087).

* [BUGFIX] Remote-write: stop dropping samples in catch-up #14446
