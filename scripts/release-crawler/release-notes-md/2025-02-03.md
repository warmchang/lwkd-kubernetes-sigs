### Release notes for v1.31.0  
#### [kops v1.31.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/tag/v1.31.0)  
#### 2025-01-28  
# Significant changes

* Kubernetes minor version upgrades to 1.31 should be performed using a new `kops reconcile` cluster command.

Kubernetes 1.31 introduces stricter checks around the version-skew policy.  While kOps has always followed the version-skew policy, there was an edge case: nodes that were added by an autoscaler during a rolling-update would not always follow the version-skew policy.  We recommend trying the new `kops reconcile` command, see [docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md) for more details.

# Other changes of note

* Cilium has been upgraded to v1.16.
* Spotinst cluster controller V1 is replaced with Ocean kubernetes controller V2, all old k8s resource are removed except spotinst-kubernetes-cluster-controller Secret.

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.25 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.31.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.26 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.32.
