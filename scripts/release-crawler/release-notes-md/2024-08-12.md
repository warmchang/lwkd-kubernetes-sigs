# Latest Releases for 2024-08-12  
## kubernetes/kops  
### Release notes for v1.30.0  
#### 2024-08-16  
# Significant changes

## Version updates

kOps 1.30 adds support for kubernetes 1.30, and updates of most of the built-in components.

This release also updates to the next generation AWS SDK (aws-sdk-go-v2), though we do not expect
user-visible changes from this update.

## Improved support for Azure

kOps on Azure has been significantly improved in this release.

## Embedded asset hashes

Hashes for many kubernetes assets have been embedded into the kOps binary.  When using
a well-known asset, we no longer need to download the hash from a well-known location,
which slightly speeds up kOps cluster creation, and also creates a stronger chain-of-trust.

## containerd/nerdctl  
### Release notes for v2.0.0-rc.1  
#### 2024-08-17  
## Changes
nerdctl v2 enables "detach-netns" for Rootless mode by default (#2723).

This will bring:
- Faster and more stable `nerdctl pull`, `nerdctl push`, `nerdctl build`, etc
- Proper support for `nerdctl pull 127.0.0.1:.../...`
- Proper support for `nerdctl run --net=host`

Depends on RootlessKit >= v2.0 and BuildKit >= v0.13 (included in `nerdctl-full-*.tar.gz`).

> [!NOTE]
> After upgrading nerdctl (rootless mode) from v1.x to v2.x, it is highly recommended to
> re-install the systemd units and the configurations:
> ```
> containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh uninstall
> rm -rf ~/.config/{nerdctl,buildkit}
> containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
> CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE=default containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install-buildkit-containerd
> ```

Other major changes:
- `nerdctl run`:
  - Add `--systemd` flag for running systemd in containers flag (#2785, thanks to @sazzy4o)
  - Add`--ipc=(shareable|container:<container>)` flag (#2757, thanks to @minuk-dev)
  - Add `--annotation` flag (#2906)
     - Now `nerdctl run --label` is only set as a containerd label and not propagated as an OCI annotation. A label with the `nerdctl/` prefix can no longer be set manually, with an exception for `nerdctl/bypass4netns`. The `nerdctl/bypass4netns` label is still allowed and is propagated to an OCI annotation, for sake of compatibility.
  - Add `--sig-proxy` flag (#3043, thanks to @CodeChanning)
  - Propagate image labels to container labels (not to container annotations) (#3023, thanks to @yankay)
  - Add `--attach` flag (#3157, thanks to @CodeChanning)
  - The restriction for `--name` is relaxed to support longer names (#3279, thanks to @Shubhranshu153)
- `nerdctl build`:
  - Add `--attest`, `--sbom`, and `--provenance` flags (#2786, thanks to @yankay)
  - Add `--pull` flag (#3074, thanks to @sondavidb)
  - Support Windows (#2587, thanks to @TBBle)
- `nerdctl ps`:
  - JSON type of `--format=json` is changed for better Docker compatibility (#2987, #3058, thanks to @apostasie and @yankay)
- `nerdctl inspect`:
  - Add `--size` flag (#3021, thanks to @apostasie)
- `nerdctl network`:
  - The networks are now aware of containerd namespaces. i.e., `nerdctl --namespace=foo network list` no longer shows networks created with `nerdctl --namespace=bar network create` (#3096, thanks to @apostasie)
  - Enhanced support for DHCP (#3001, thanks to @apostasie)
- `nerdctl compose up`:
  - Add `--abort-on-container-exit` flag (#2873, thanks to @alegrey91)
- `nerdctl builder prune`:
  - Add `--all` flag (#3316, thanks to @austinvazquez)
  - Add `--force` flag (#3316, thanks to @austinvazquez)
- `nerdctl image prune`:
  - Add `--filter` flag (#3319, thanks to @austinvazquez)
- nerdct-full:
  - (See the `Included components` below)
- And more!

## kubernetes-sigs/kind  
### Release notes for v0.24.0  
#### 2024-08-15  
Highlights from this release include network policy support using [sigs.k8s.io/kube-network-policies](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-network-policies) (thanks @aojea!) and support for building node images from pre-compiled Kubernetes releases (thanks @dims!).

For building images, see the docs at https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#building-images


<h1 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</h1>

- The default node image is now Kubernetes v1.31.0: `kindest/node:v1.31.0@sha256:53df588e04085fd41ae12de0c3fe4c72f7013bba32a20e7325357a1ac94ba865`


<h1 id="new-features">New Features</h1>

- **Out-of-the-box support for network policy via [sigs.k8s.io/kube-network-policies](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-network-policies)**
  - Advanced users can still disable kindnetd and install your own CNI with https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#disable-default-cni, however note that this is a "power user" feature and KIND does not offer support for any third-party CNI
- **Support for building node images from existing Kubernetes releases**
  - **NOTE**: For Kubernetes releases before v1.31.0, this will result in larger images because kind opted in to compiling out remaining in-tree cloud providers with a build tag when publishing images. For v1.31.0+ there is no difference.
  - See: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#building-images
- Support for loading multiple image archives in `kind load image-archive`
  - **NOTE**: it is still more efficient to do a single archive in most cases
- Migrated to skipPhase in Init/JoinConfiguration instead of the kubeadm flags, making it possible for users to cutomize the phases (at your own risk!) with config patches
- powershell completion
- Updated dependencies, including, but not limited to:
  - containerd 1.7.18
  - runc 1.1.13
  - go 1.22.6
  - CNI plugins to 1.5.1
  - pause 3.10
- Docs and clarification for third party install options including scoop and winget

**NOTE**: You *must* use the `@sha256` digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme. Even then we will highly encourage digest pinning for security and reproducibility reasons.

NOTE: These node images support amd64 and arm64, both of our supported platforms. **You must use the same platform as your host,** for more context see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2718

<h1 id="fixes">Fixes</h1>

- Fix kubeadm v1beta3 config template for kubeProxyMode: none
- Stop disabling LocalStorageIsolation for rootless clusters (which no longer appears to be necessary to avoid crashes)

## kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder  
### Release notes for v4.2.0  
#### 2024-08-17  
**changes since [v4.1.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/v4.1.1)**

### ⚠️ **Important Notice:** 

> _The artefacts for [ENVTEST](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/main/pkg/envtest) from k8s `1.31` are exclusively available at: [Controller Tools Releases](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/releases). Kubebuilder no longer builds and promote the ENVTEST artefacts at the old location [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubebuilder-tools](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubebuilder-tools) which is deprecated and can no longer be ensured by Kubebuilder maintainers. **You should ensure that your projects are using the new location**. For further information, see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/discussions/4082_
>
> **This update is fully transparent for Kubebuilder users assuming that they properly update their scaffolds to use setup-envtest from controller-runtime branch `release-0.19`.** 
> 
> ```shell
> # To know the available versions check: 
> # - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/blob/main/envtest-releases.yaml
> ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION = 1.31.0
> # Controller-Runtime branch `release-0.19` has the implementation of the setup-envtest's code responsible
> # for downloading the tarball from the correct location.
> ENVTEST_VERSION ?= release-0.19
>
> ...
> .PHONY: envtest
> envtest: $(ENVTEST) ## Download setup-envtest locally if necessary.
> $(ENVTEST): $(LOCALBIN)
> 	$(call go-install-tool,$(ENVTEST),sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/tools/setup-envtest,$(ENVTEST_VERSION))
> ```


### ✨ New Features
- **(go/v4, kustomize/v2)**: Add support to protect project with [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) (#3853)
- **(go/v4)**: Add support to k8s 1.31 (#4080)
- **(go/v4)**: Upgrading controller-runtime from v0.18.4 to v0.19.0 (#4080)
- **(go/v4)**: Upgrading controller-tools from v0.15.0 to v0.16.1 (#4080)
- **(go/v4, kustomize/v2)**: Upgrade kustomize from v5.4.2 to v5.4.3 (#4084)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **(go/v4)**: Add missing cancel context to controller's suite-test (#4067)
- ⚠️ **(Only relevant for users of Kubebuilder as a library)**: ImplementWebhooks should only be used by the e2e tests and should be under its package. Therefore, this method is no longer served under `pkg/plugin/util` (#4065)
