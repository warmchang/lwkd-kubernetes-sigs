Previous release can be found at [v2.0.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on Linux distributions that do not use glibc >= 2.35. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.

See also the [Getting Started](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.
  
### Release notes for containerd 2.1.0-rc.1  
#### [containerd v2.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.1)  
#### 2025-05-07  
Welcome to the v2.1.0-rc.1 release of containerd!
*This is a pre-release of containerd*

The first minor release of containerd 2.x focuses on continued stability alongside
new features and improvements. This is the first time-based released for containerd.

#### Image Distribution

* Retry last registry host on 50x responses ([#11484](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11484))
* Multipart layer fetch ([#10177](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/10177))
* Enable HTTP debug and trace for transfer based puller ([#10762](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/10762))
* Add support for unpacking custom media types  ([#11744](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11744))

### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on Linux distributions that do not use glibc >= 2.35. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.

See also the [Getting Started](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.

### Release notes for v1.32.0  
#### [kops v1.32.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/tag/v1.32.0)  
#### 2025-05-07  
## Release notes for kOps 1.32 series

kOps 1.32 is a smaller release without significant additional features beyond updated support for kubernetes 1.32 and associated ecosystem updates. Significant kOps features will instead target kOps 1.33.

# Significant changes

## Kubernetes minor version upgrades to 1.31 or later should be performed using the `kops reconcile cluster command.

* Kubernetes 1.31 introduced stricter checks around the version-skew policy. While kOps has always followed the version-skew policy, there was an edge case:
nodes that were added by an autoscaler during a rolling-update would not always follow the version-skew policy.
We recommend trying the new kops reconcile command, see [docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md) for more details.
The `kops reconcile` functionality was introduced in kOps 1.32.

* flannel is no longer planned to be removed and has been updated to v0.26.4.

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.26 is deprecated and is removed in kOps 1.32.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.27 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.33.
